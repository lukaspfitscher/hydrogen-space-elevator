# hydrogen-space-elevator
All about making a hydrogen space elevator (physics, materials, chemistry, software, calculations)

- best lift gas seems to be hydrogen, even if it is explosiv
- hydrogen can be made from electricity and water
- hydrogen is leaking through many material
- Wind would be a problem, is there a place where no wind is?
- The bigger the balloon the more volume compared to surface area can be safed.

On every 1000m some hydrogen need to be placed to compensate the weight of the robe. 
With this ccompensate for the robe never experiences the full weight of the total structur.

1m2 hydrogen can carry about 1kg of weight

list of weigth to carry by the hydrogen balloons
- the actual balloon
- the robe for carrying the elevator and
- human
- motor for elevating

The elevator will be driven by solarpanels attached to the elevator. Or by a high voltage current source. 
so to make a elavator for one person.
