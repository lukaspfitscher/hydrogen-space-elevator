# hydrogen-space-elevator
All about making a hydrogen space elevator (physics, materials, chemistry, software, calculations)

- best lift gas seems to be hydrogen, even if it is explosiv
- hydrogen can be made from electricity and water
- hydrogen is leaking through many material
- wind would be a problem, is there a place where no wind is?
- The bigger the balloon the more volume compared to surface area can be safed.

On every 1000m some hydrogen balloon need to be placed to compensate the weight of the robe. 
With this compensate for the robe, the robe will never experiences the full weight of the total structur.

1 m^2 hydrogen can carry about 1kg of weight

list of weigth to carry by the hydrogen balloons
- the actual balloon
- the robe for carrying the elevator
- cargo (human or robot) 
- motor for elevating

The elevator will be driven by solarpanels attached to the elevator. Or by a high voltage current source. 
so to make a elavator for one person.

Amount of hydrogen needed

Robe: Tensil strengh 1000kg, 0.0128kg/m (lengh 25m, 0.32kg): 
Weight of the inner robe = 0.0128kg/m * 30000m = 384kg

Sphere surface formula: A=4πr^2
Sphere volume  formula: A=4/3*πr^3
dry air has a density of about 1.29 kg/m3
hydrogen density 0.08375 kg/m3
uplift is than = 1.2kg/m3

for the robe (390kg) and a human (60kg) and a elevator (100kg) you would than need (550kg, 550/1.2 = 460m3)
that would be a cube of site length of square3(460m3), 8m

price hydrogen: 3.4€ per m^3 (460m3 would than be 2000euro, it is not much!)

A ballone in a balloon for hydrogen. will this decrease diffusion?
